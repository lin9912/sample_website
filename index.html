               <p>
                  Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.

                 When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stasheson his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designinginterfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of theinterface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

                 You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on JimmyKimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerdat heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from atour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
